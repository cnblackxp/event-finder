# Event Finder Application
## notes:

consider running the application from within XCode if you want to test iOS version.
the applications testing was done primarly on iOS, so please take that into consideration.

I used functional components with hooks to develop the application.

I was intending on using an API to get the events but didn't have enough time to do so, so I wrote a mockup json and used it instead.

This Application was Developed by Hazem Marwan Huzayen - 2019-10-08
